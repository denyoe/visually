The reason why I have choosen this institution is, first there is a huge cultural difference between the place where I studied and also came to know about the technologies that they use in France. It will be a great opportunity for me to study in France, mainly cultural and get this back to my country. It will be a pleasure for me to work in France and because France has also two years of work visa, it will be a great exposure for me.
